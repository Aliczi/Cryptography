## Number Generator

The Blum–Blum–Shub (BBS) pseudorandom bit generator is one of the most efficient pseudorandom number generators known that is provably secure under the assumption that factoring large composites is intractable (see integerfactoring). The generator makes use of modulararithmetic.

## Visual Cryptography
Visual cryptography is a cryptographic technique which allows visual information (pictures, text, etc.) to be encrypted in such a way that the decrypted information appears as a visual image.
